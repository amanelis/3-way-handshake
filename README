C TCP Dump Log Analyzer
Written by Alex Manelis

parse.c - 
This was the original attempt at trying to read the packets
and information. Its implementation is not as effective as 
wanted considering I am doing multiple reads. This is why 
the second implementation is the real working one. 

parse_lab.c -
This file correctly reads the data and stores to a buffer.
Working on implementing a packet manipulation function that
will then send out manipulated packets on network.

Dependencies -
1.) ldnet
2.) lpcap
3.) tcpdump, w/ dump file

INSTALL & RUNNING -
$>make
$>./lparse [network log file]
