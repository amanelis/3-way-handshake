C TCP Dump Log Analyzer
Written by Alex Manelis <amanelis@gmail.com>

parse.c - 
This was the original attempt at trying to read the packets
and information. Its implementation is not as effective as 
wanted considering I am doing multiple reads. This is why 
the second implementation is the real working one. 

parse_lab.c -
This file correctly reads the data and stores to a buffer.
Working on implementing a packet manipulation function that
will then send out manipulated packets on network. Does not
properly resend packets to make three way hand shake.

driver.c -
This file properly sends packets to network. Working on 
confirming the three way handshake


Dependencies -
1.) ldnet
2.) lpcap
3.) tcpdump, w/ dump file
4.) bit-twist (not implemented yet, in future)

INSTALL & RUNNING -
$>make driver
$>./driver [network log file] [config file]

In the logs/ dir, I have included some TCP dump files you can
demo your executables on. I would try:

$>./driver logs/syn.64.log logs/cfg.alex

PACKETS DIR
This directory was used to generate packets using the program
bit-twist. As for my packet manipulation that is the next library
I will be including in this application.
